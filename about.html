        with products that focus on maintaining an ageless radiance and glow with each 
        use. Each product is carefully formulated with natural ingredients because we 
        trust in a holistic approach;  to us, nature provides and heals. Skincare is

    <h2>
        Our History
    </h2>
    <p>
        T'ika Skin was established in 2020, and during this year, my passion for 
        herbalism was awakened. The world shut down, and we used this time to 
        focus on the deeper levels of self in many ways. Being Peruvian, I realized 
        herbalism takes me back to my ancestors in Peru. Even though I was 
        learning new things, it felt familiar and flowed effortlessly. In 2021, we 
        closed our doors to focus on more profound healing and deeper levels of 
        self because your current energy can impact the quality of your product. 
        After many challenges, we were able to reopen in February 2024. I pray that 
        you will feel every drop of love put into each product to make you look and 
        feel your best, using high-quality ingredients that take you back to the 
        natural world. T'ika Skin is where love lives, confidence lives, and God lives.
